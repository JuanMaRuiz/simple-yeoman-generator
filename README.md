# Simple Yeoman generator - Bazinga
Hi my name is *Bazinga* and I'm a very simple [Yeoman](yeoman.io) generator.

I have been created from scratch. The idea behind me is also simple, help my human to scaffold a basic node project. Here is what I'll generate:

```bash
.
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintrc.js
├── .travis.yml
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── test
    └── index.test.js
```

So there are a lot of work to do but this is the begining ...

> If you take a look to my soul and you have any time to recommend me some improvements ... feel free to do it!

### TODO List
* Create subgenerators: node, webapp (index.html, styles.css, ..)
* ~~Add tests to generator~~
* ~~Fix dependencies~~
* ~~Add tests to application~~
