# Simple Yeoman generator - Bazinga
Hi my name is *Bazinga* and I'm a very simple [Yeoman](yeoman.io) generator.

I have been created from scratch. The idea behind me is also simple, how can I be created?.

So there are a lot of work to do but this is the begining ...

> If you take a look to my soul and you have any time to recommend me some improvements ... feel free to do it!

### TODO List
* Add tests to generator
* Configure Gruntfile correctly. Now add a Gruntfile example
* Fix dependencies
* Add tests to application
